# Welcome to my rework of my Portfolio!

Since the last time I made my portfolio, I have learned a lot more about web development and design. I have also learned a lot more about myself and what I want to do with my life. I have decided to rework my portfolio to reflect my new skills and my new goals. I hope you enjoy it! This is a work in progress, so please be patient with me as I work on it. I starting with a clean architecture design, using .net and have not decided on what front-end I want to use or try out. I am leaning towards React, but I am not sure yet. I will update this README as I go along.

## Getting Started

- Tech Stack
  - REST API
    - Rest API written in .NET Core 7.0
  

#### Error Handling

- Error handling is done using the [Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) RFC standard.
- The `ProblemDetails` class is used to return errors in a consistent format, with a link to a help page containing details about the error.
